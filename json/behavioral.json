      "answer": "S: At Manhattan Associates, while crafting advanced BI dashboards and engineering ingestion pipelines from diverse sources like Jira and Oracle, I encountered persistent and complex data discrepancies. These issues were deeply embedded in outdated Power Query logic and inconsistent data coming from source systems, leading to inaccurate reports and impacting our goal to increase cross-departmental data visibility by 60%. T: My primary task was to not just identify but definitively solve these complex data quality issues to improve report accuracy by 25% and ensure reliable, trustworthy data for all our BI initiatives, including SLA compliance tracking dashboards. A: I approached this by applying a rigorous root cause analysis. I meticulously traced the data flow through each stage of the ingestion pipelines, from source system APIs to the SQL Server destination. I then dissected the existing Power Query logic, line by line, identifying numerous instances of inefficient joins, incorrect data type conversions, and missing validation rules. My solution involved refactoring this outdated Power Query logic to support parameterized refreshes and a modular query structure, which inherently improved data consistency. Furthermore, I instituted data quality checkpoints and validation rules within the reports themselves, acting as an early warning system for anomalies. R: This comprehensive approach successfully resolved the complex data discrepancies. The refactored pipelines and new data quality checkpoints led to a verifiable 25% improvement in report accuracy. This significantly boosted user trust in our analytics, enabling us to confidently deliver 20+ advanced BI dashboards and contribute to decreasing SLA violations by 18%. My solution not only fixed the immediate problems but also established a more robust and reliable data foundation for future reporting.",

      "answer": "S: At Manhattan Associates, I was leading the development of 20+ advanced BI dashboards aimed at increasing cross-departmental data visibility by 60%. A key stakeholder, the Head of Sales, frequently requested significant scope changes mid-sprint, including entirely new data sources and complex visualizations, often contradicting previously agreed-upon requirements. T: My goal was to deliver high-quality dashboards on schedule while managing the stakeholder's evolving demands without compromising project integrity or team morale. A: I scheduled dedicated discovery sessions with the Head of Sales to understand the why behind their requests, clearly articulated the impact of scope changes on timelines, and proposed a phased approach: delivering core features first and incorporating high-priority requests into subsequent iterations. I also presented how features like parameterized refreshes and modular query structures could make future additions easier. R: This strategy successfully mitigated scope creep. The Head of Sales gained a clearer understanding of the development process and prioritized their requests more effectively. We delivered the initial suite of dashboards on time, significantly increasing data visibility, while subsequent phases incorporated valuable new features without derailing core deliverables.",
