      "The instructor draws a parallel to Excel pivot tables' drill-down functionality, explaining that while Excel allows users to expand rows/columns to see underlying data, Power BI's drill-through provides a more sophisticated experience by taking users to customized report pages with relevant context-filtered visualizations rather than just showing raw data. This creates a guided analytical path for users to explore data relationships across multiple dimensions while maintaining the visual presentation format."

      "The instructor emphasizes practical applications like using tooltips to show trend lines when hovering over a bar chart, displaying top contributors when hovering over a total, or revealing additional KPIs without cluttering the main report. These dynamic tooltips can be accessed through Power BI's Format panel where users select a visual, navigate to the Format tab, and under the Tooltip section choose the custom tooltip page from the dropdown menu.",
      "The fundamental difference between custom and dynamic tooltips is that custom tooltips are pre-designed tooltip pages that show the same layout of visuals for any data point (though the data shown adapts to the selection), while dynamic tooltips intelligently change their structure and content based on the specific data point being hovered over, often incorporating DAX measures and conditional formatting to determine what information appears and how it's presented. Custom tooltips are static in design but dynamic in data, whereas truly dynamic tooltips are flexible in both design and data presentation."
