      "question": "Can you describe your experience with Power BI?",
      "answer": "I have over 6 years of hands-on experience using Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service. I’ve developed 50+ interactive dashboards across healthcare, insurance, retail, and IT operations, integrating data from SQL Server, Oracle, and APIs using Power Query. I specialize in DAX, RLS, and scalable data modeling.",

    },
    {
      "serial_no": 2,
      "question": "How do you ensure data accuracy in your reports?",
      "answer": "I implement validation rules during data transformation, use test datasets to verify DAX measures, and apply visual indicators to highlight anomalies. I also work closely with stakeholders to validate KPIs and build refresh audit logic using Power BI Service and Dataflows.",

    },
    {
      "serial_no": 3,
      "question": "What’s your approach to data modeling in Power BI?",
      "answer": "I follow a star schema approach wherever possible, use role-playing dimensions, create calculated tables for hierarchy, and ensure relationships are single-direction unless needed. I optimize with summarization tables and minimize row-level calculations in visuals.",

      "skills": ["Data Modeling", "Star Schema", "Relationships", "Calculated Tables", "Performance Tuning"]
    },
    {
      "serial_no": 4,
      "question": "Explain Row-Level Security (RLS) and how you’ve used it.",
      "answer": "RLS restricts data access based on user roles. At Northside Hospital, I implemented RLS on clinical dashboards so each department could only see its own patients and metrics. I defined roles in Power BI and validated them using the 'View As Role' feature before deployment.",

    },
    {
      "serial_no": 5,
      "question": "How do you handle performance issues in Power BI reports?",
      "answer": "I use tools like Performance Analyzer and DAX Studio. I optimize slow visuals by using calculated columns instead of measures when needed, removing unused columns from the data model, avoiding bi-directional relationships, and aggregating data before loading it into Power BI.",

    {
      "serial_no": 6,
      "question": "Have you worked with Power BI Gateways and Dataflows?",
      "answer": "Yes. At Manhattan Associates, I configured on-premise gateways to refresh SQL Server data and used Dataflows for shared ETL logic across multiple reports. This setup standardized refresh pipelines and improved maintainability.",

      "skills": ["Power BI Gateway", "Dataflows", "ETL", "SQL Server", "Automation"]
    },
    {
      "serial_no": 7,
      "question": "How do you manage version control with PBIX files?",
      "answer": "I use Git to version control datasets and documentation. For PBIX files, I follow a naming convention with timestamps and store release notes in Markdown. I’ve also experimented with breaking reports into dataset and report layers using deployment pipelines in Power BI Service.",

      "question": "Describe a dashboard you’re proud of.",
      "answer": "At Hiscox Insurance, I built a fraud detection dashboard combining claims data with external trend indicators. It used AI insights, conditional formatting, and layered drill-through filters. The dashboard reduced review time by 60% and surfaced $750K in premium misalignment.",

      "question": "How do you stay updated with Power BI features?",
      "answer": "I follow Guy in a Cube, SQLBI, and the official Power BI blog. I also test features in the monthly preview updates and share internal demos with my team during knowledge transfer sessions.",

    {
      "serial_no": 10,
      "question": "What do you think makes a great Power BI dashboard?",
      "answer": "Clarity, speed, and purpose. A great dashboard should answer business questions in under 5 seconds, have intuitive layout and navigation, and be visually consistent. It must tell a story without requiring user explanation.",
